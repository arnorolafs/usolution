        We are dissatisfied with what we are getting out of our current technological setup and are therefore contemplating changing
        platforms. Before we do so, we are extremely interested in having our technological infrastructure analyzed from an outside
        source. Main focus should first and foremost be on improving profitability. In case that this analysis proves that the best/only course of action is to make change, we would appreciate it if the report 
        had recommendation for different it-solutions.
